# Web Deployment

DreamFlow makes it easy to take your app live on the web with minimal setup. You can quickly publish apps for testing, demos, or full production use, directly from your browser.

DreamFlow offers two flexible options:

- **One-Click Deployment:** Instantly publish your app to the web in just seconds, perfect for previews and prototypes.
- **Custom Web Deployment:** Gain more control over the deployment process, with configuration options tailored for production-ready apps.

## One-Click Deployment

With **One-Click Deployment**, you can instantly publish your app to the web without any additional setup. DreamFlow automatically builds and hosts your project under a shareable DreamFlow URL.

To deploy your app, navigate to **Publish > Web** and click **One-Click Deployment**. DreamFlow will automatically build and host your app at a unique subdomain (e.g., `https://<your-app>.share.dreamflow.app`).

If you make changes to your project, click **Update Deployment** to publish the latest version. You can click **Unpublish** to remove the app from its live URL whenever you no longer want it accessible.
