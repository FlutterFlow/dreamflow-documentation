# Quickstart

When starting a new Dreamflow project you have three options:

- **[Start from a prompt](/quickstart#start-with-a-prompt)**: when you want to get a jumpstart on a brand new app idea.
- **[Start from scratch](/quickstart#start-from-scratch)**: when you want to incrementally build from a blank project.
- **[Start from a template](/quickstart#start-from-a-template)**: when you want to start from an existing beautiful, tailored app.


## Start With a Prompt

Dreamflow's AI-powered app generation allows you to create fully functional, production-ready applications from simple text and image descriptions. Simply describe what you want to build, additionally add screenshots for design inspiration, and Dreamflow Agent will generate the entire app structure, UI components, and functionality for you.

Ready to create your app? Simply:

1. Open Dreamflow and click the textbox that says "Start with a prompt..."
2. Enter your app description and wait for the Agent to generate your complete app.
3. Review and customize the generated project in the [workspace](#).


The Agent will create all the necessary screens, components, and functionality based on your description, giving you a fully functional app that you can further customize and deploy.

***Prompt used:** Build a sleek music streaming app like Spotify, with a dark theme, album art grids, a bottom navigation bar (Home, Search, Library) and a clean now-playing screen with controls and progress bar.*

### Sample Prompts

Here are some prompts that we've used recently while chatting with the agent.

#### A habit tracker

**Prompt**
    
    Build the main screen for a habit tracking app. Prepopulate with common habits, and then show the tasks for today on this main screen. Make the app look modern and whimsical.


**Duration / Cost**: 161 seconds / 2.51 credits

**Next steps**
    - Let the user enter their own habits
    - Give the user reminders for their habits, even when the app is not running.
    - Allow the user to share their habit progress with others (through the share sheet of the mobile OS)


#### Asteroids game

**Prompt**

Replace the main screen with an implementation of the classic game of Asteroids. Make this look and work the same as the original arcade game. Make sure that it has keyboard controls, mouse controls, and touch controls. Store the high-score locally.

**Duration / Cost** : 183 seconds / 2.30 credits

**Next steps**
    - Give the game a start screen (with instructions)
    - Give the game an end screen (with a leaderboard)
    - Store a leaderboard of highscores on a server



#### Chat app

**Prompt**

Build a small chat app (store the data locally for now) where users can chat with their friends. Make the app look modern and familiar, but also give it some unique twists.

**Duration / Cost** : 313 seconds /  4.42 credits

**Next steps**
    - Make the chats clustered when folks are close to each other
    - Store the chat data in a cloud database
    - Show a notification when a message arrives when the app is not active


## Start from Scratch 

When you create a project from scratch, you'll begin with Flutter's classic counter app template. From there, you have multiple ways to build out your application:

- Use the **[AI Agent](../workspace/agent-panel.md)** to add features through natural language conversations.
- Add new UI elements to your page through the **[Widget Tree]**
- Visually construct your UI with the **[Properties Editor](../workspace/properties-panel.md)** and drag-and-drop tools.
- Write and edit code directly in the integrated **[Code Editor](../workspace/content-panel.md#code-editor)**.
- Combine these approaches seamlessly as your project grows.

This flexibility allows you to work in whatever way best suits your development style and project needs.

Simply choose a template that matches your needs and customize it to create your unique application.
