# Welcome to Dreamflow

**The Fastest Way to Build Mobile Apps**

Dreamflow is an AI-first platform that combines code, visual, and agentic development for Flutter—no install, no lock-in, production-ready workflows. Transform your ideas into production-ready mobile apps in minutes using natural language prompts and our integrated development environment.

## Key Features

- **[AI Agent](workspace/agent-panel.md)**: Prompt small edits or large refactors with natural language commands. The AI agent can scaffold entire screens, implement complex flows, and generate comprehensive tests, making development faster and more intuitive than traditional coding approaches.

- **[Realtime Preview](workspace/content-panel.md#app-preview)**: See your changes instantly with a live run session that compiles and previews your app in real-time. Inspect logs, monitor state changes, and debug issues as they happen, providing immediate feedback for faster iteration and development.

- **Integrations**: Built-in Firebase and Supabase integrations provide seamless backend services out of the box. Connect to databases, implement authentication, handle file storage, and manage real-time data without complex setup or configuration.

- **[Visual Widget Tree](workspace/modules-panel/widget-panel.md)**: Add, remove, move, wrap, collapse, and expand UI components with intuitive visual controls. Restructure your entire widget hierarchy instantly through drag-and-drop interactions, making UI development more visual and accessible.

- **[Properties Editor](workspace/properties-panel.md)**: Type-safe controls for every widget property with intelligent suggestions and validation. Use expressions, formulas, or simply ask the AI for assistance when configuring complex widget behaviors and styling.

- **Deploy**: Push your applications to the web or app stores with streamlined one-click deployment. Support for multiple platforms including Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux ensures your app reaches users everywhere.

- **Full File System Access**: Browse, edit, and organize real project files with complete transparency. No abstractions or hidden layers—you have direct access to your Flutter code, allowing for full customization and integration with existing development workflows.

- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly as you develop with Flutter's hot reload technology, enabling rapid iteration and real-time feedback during the development process.

- **Debug Console**: Monitor app logs and performance in real-time with integrated debugging tools that help you identify and resolve issues quickly.

- **Asset Management**: Upload and organize images, fonts, and files through an intuitive interface that keeps your project resources organized and accessible.

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Build applications that run seamlessly across mobile (iOS and Android), web (responsive), and desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) platforms from a single codebase.

## How It Works

Dreamflow follows a simple 3-step workflow: **Start → Build → Run & Ship**

### 1. Start
Kick off from a natural-language prompt, a blank Flutter project, or import an existing repo (coming soon).

### 2. Build
Jump between multiple development modes to build your app efficiently:

- Use the **Code** editor for direct Flutter development
- Navigate the **Visual widget tree** for drag-and-drop UI building
- Configure components in the **Properties editor** with type-safe controls
- Leverage the **AI agent** to scaffold features and refactor code through natural language

Built-in Firebase and Supabase integrations provide authentication, database, and storage capabilities without complex setup. The integrated **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** delivers intelligent code completions, quick fixes, and real-time diagnostics as you type.

### 3. Run & Ship
A managed run session compiles and previews your app in real time. Connect Firebase/Supabase, test flows, and deploy to web or the app stores when ready.
