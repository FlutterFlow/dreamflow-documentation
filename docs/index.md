# Welcome to Dreamflow

**The Fastest Way to Build Mobile Apps**

Dreamflow is an AI-first platform that combines agentic, visual and code development for Flutter — no install, no lock-in, production-ready workflows. Transform your ideas into production-ready mobile apps in minutes using natural language prompts and our integrated development environment.

## Key Features

In Dreamflow, the code is always the single source of truth. Whether you build with the agent, use visual controls, or edit the source directly - the code is updated in realtime as you build.

- **[AI Agent](workspace/agent-panel.md)**: Start a new app, get a jump start on new features for your existing project, or get help fixing issues using natural language commands. The AI agent can scaffold entire screens, implement complex flows, and help add debug outputs - making development faster and easier to understand.

- **[Realtime Preview](workspace/content-panel.md#app-preview)**: See your changes instantly with a live run session that compiles and previews your app in real-time. Inspect logs, monitor state changes, and debug issues as they happen, providing immediate feedback for faster iteration and development.

- **[Visual Widget Tree](workspace/modules-panel/widget-panel.md)**: Add, remove, move, wrap, collapse, and expand UI components with intuitive visual controls. Restructure your entire widget hierarchy instantly through drag-and-drop interactions, making UI development more visual and accessible.

- **[Visual Property Editors](workspace/properties-panel.md)**: Type-safe controls for every widget property with intelligent suggestions and validation. Visually select different styles, use code expressions, or simply ask the AI for assistance when configuring complex widget behaviors and styling.

- **Deploy**: Push your applications to the web or app stores with streamlined one-click deployment. Support for multiple platforms including Web, iOS, and Android ensures your app reaches users everywhere.


## How It Works

Dreamflow follows a simple 3-step workflow: **Start → Iterate → Ship**

### 1. Start
Kick off from a natural-language prompt, a blank Flutter project, or import an existing Flutter repo using git (coming soon).

### 2. Iterate
Jump between multiple development modes to build your app efficiently:

- Leverage the **AI agent** to get a jump start on new features or for help debugging.
- Add, remove or rearrange UI elements (Widgets) in the **visual Widget Tree**.
- Configure arguments for widgets visually in the **Properties editor** with type-safe controls.
- Use the **Code** editor to peak under-the-hood and see what's going on.


Built-in Firebase and Supabase integrations provide authentication and database capabilities without complex setup. The integrated **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** delivers intelligent code completions, quick fixes, and real-time diagnostics as you type.

            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}

        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

### 3. Ship
A managed run session compiles and previews your app in real time. Connect Firebase/Supabase, test flows, and deploy to web or the app stores when ready.
