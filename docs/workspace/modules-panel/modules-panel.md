# Modules Panel 

The Modules Panel enabled from the left side of the builder interface, provides access to different functional modules for managing your Flutter project.

## Available Modules

- **[View Explorer Module](../modules-panel/widget-panel.md)**: Provides isolated previews of your full application, individual pages, and components, enabling you to test UI states with sample data, inspect variations quickly, and jump directly to any screen without navigating through the app flow.

- **[Theme Module](../modules-panel/theme.md)**: Manages app theming and styling by providing tools to customize colors, fonts, typography, and design tokens that are accessible across your application.

- **[Assets Module](../modules-panel/assets.md)**: Handles project asset management by allowing you to upload images, organize files, and manage all project resources in one centralized location.

- **[Firebase Module](../../integrations/firebase.md)**: Configures Firebase integration for backend services including authentication, database, storage, and other Firebase-powered features.

- **[Supabase Module](../../integrations/supabase.md)**: Sets up Supabase backend integration for database management, authentication, and real-time subscriptions to power your app's backend functionality.

- **[Git Module](../../integrations/git.md)**: Connects your Dreamflow project to a Git repository.
