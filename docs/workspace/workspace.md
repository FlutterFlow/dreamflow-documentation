# Workspace

The workspace is organized into several specialized panels that work together to provide a complete development experience. Each panel focuses on specific aspects of your project while maintaining seamless integration with the overall workflow.

## Core Panels

- **Top Bar**: Central command center for project navigation, panel management, and deployment. Provides access to project settings, undo/redo functionality, panel visibility controls, and deployment actions.

- **[Modules Panel](modules-panel/widget-panel.md)**: Helps users access different functional areas of the platform. Includes Widget Tree (default navigation), Theme (styling), Assets (file management), Firebase (backend services), and Supabase (database integration).

- **[Content Panel](../workspace/content-panel.md)**: Main workspace area that displays either the app preview or code editor depending on the selected mode. Features real-time app preview with device frame options, hot reload/restart controls, and integrated Monaco code editor with syntax highlighting.

- **[Properties Panel](../workspace/properties-panel.md)**: Comprehensive property editing interface for selected widgets. Provides intelligent property editors for colors, text styles, padding, borders, gradients, and more, with real-time visual feedback and specialized controls for different Flutter property types.

- **[Agent Panel](../workspace/agent-panel.md)**: AI-powered development assistant that helps you build and modify your Flutter app through natural language conversations. Features streaming conversations, context management, screenshot integration, and support for multiple AI models.


This integrated workspace approach eliminates the need to switch between different tools and provides a cohesive environment for building, testing, and deploying Flutter applications.
