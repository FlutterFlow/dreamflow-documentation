# Firebase

Dreamflow makes it easy to integrate [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) into your app with a guided, step-by-step setup. This process connects your project to Firebase, generates all necessary configuration, and even creates ready-to-use client code and database rules with AI.

By integrating Firebase, you gain access to services such as Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, Hosting and more, giving your app a secure backend for managing users, data, and serverless logic.

## 1. Connection

The first step is to connect Dreamflow with your Google account so it can create new Firebase projects or link to existing ones.

To connect Dreamflow with Firebase, open the **Firebase** tab in Dreamflow, then click **Connect to Firebase**. When the OAuth window appears, sign in with your Google account, review, and approve the requested permissions. These permissions allow Dreamflow to create Firebase projects, manage configurations, and deploy security rules.

Once complete, Dreamflow will confirm the connection with a **Connected** status.

<p></p>

### Initial Firebase Project Setup

If this is your first time connecting to Firebase, you must create a new project in the Firebase Console and accept the Terms of Service before continuing.

Open the Firebase Console and ensure you are signed in with the correct account. Click **Get started** tile, enter a project name, accept the terms, and complete the setup. During this process, you can disable Gemini AI and Analytics features if they are not required.

When the console displays the message *“Your Firebase project is ready”*, close the tab and return to Dreamflow. Click **Proceed** to continue. It may take a few minutes for the new project to appear in Dreamflow.

Here’s how to do it step by step:


<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(52.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding

    </iframe>
</div>
<p></p>

## 2. Project Setup

After connecting your Google account, the next step is to set up a Firebase project, which will serve as the backend for your app. You can do this in two ways:

- **Select an existing Firebase project:** Choose from the list of your existing Firebase projects.

    ![select-from-existing-project](imgs/select-from-existing-project.avif)
- **Create a new Firebase project:** Let Dreamflow automatically create and configure a new Firebase project for you.

    ![create-new-project](imgs/create-new-project.avif)

Once the project is linked, you need to specify the following:

- **Target Platforms:** Choose the platforms you want to support (Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows). Web is always enabled by default, so your app can be previewed inside Dreamflow. Selecting the right platforms ensures Firebase generates configs for each build target.
- **Bundle ID:** Enter a unique **Bundle ID** (e.g., `com.yourcompany.appname`). This must match the app identifier in your platform-specific builds (iOS bundle ID, Android package name). If you skip this, Firebase cannot configure services for mobile apps.

When these details are set, click **Configure Firebase** to complete the setup.

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(52.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/Ux3hDEIPtZ1qaVHtIKnf?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title=""
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"

        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p></p>


:::info

Behind the scenes, Dreamflow uses the **FlutterFire CLI** to handle the configuration. This process generates a `firebase_options.dart` file containing project-specific credentials such as API keys, app ID, and messaging sender ID. These credentials ensure your app is properly connected to Firebase services.

:::

:::warning

Once configured, changing the **Bundle ID** later will require reconfiguring Firebase and may break existing builds. Choose carefully before proceeding.

:::

## 3. Generate Client Code

Once your Firebase project is linked and configured, click **Generate with Agent** to automatically add the code needed to access Firebase services. This step automates a complete Firebase integration tailored to your app, wiring up authentication, Firestore, state management, and updating the existing app logic with little to no manual effort.

:::info

- This step is optional, but we strongly recommend doing it. It saves significant development time by scaffolding schemas, services, and security rules automatically to ensure your Firebase integration is both secure and production-ready from the start.
- The generated code is fully editable and serves as a starting point for customization.

:::

![generate-client-code.avif](imgs/generate-client-code.avif)

### Code Generation Breakdown

When you click **Generate with Agent**, Dreamflow performs several background steps, including (but not limited to):

- **Firebase Configuration Files**
    - Creates and updates core Firebase files such as `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, and `firebase_options.dart`.
    - These files define how your app connects to Firebase, which services are enabled, and enforce security rules and query indexes.
- **Firestore Schema & Services**
    - Generates a `firestore_data_schema.dart` file to define collections and documents.
    - Implements a `firebase_service.dart` repository class to handle Firestore operations (CRUD, queries, synchronization).
    - Adds indexes and security rules to enforce per-user access control.
- **Authentication System**
    - Creates an `auth_service.dart` for sign-in/sign-out logic.
    - Adds an `auth_wrapper.dart` to manage authentication state across the app.
    - Updates `main.dart` to initialize Firebase and route users based on authentication state.
- **App Screens**
    - Updates app pages to fetch and display live data from Firestore instead of hardcoded values.
    - Adds authentication screens to handle user sign-in and sign-up flows.
- **Dependencies & Compilation**
    - Updates `pubspec.yaml` with required Firebase dependencies.
    - Resolves version conflicts and ensures successful compilation.
    

:::info[Enable Services in Firebase Console]

After Dreamflow generates code for Firebase services, you must enable those services in the Firebase Console for them to function correctly. For example:

- **Authentication:** Enable required sign-in methods such as Email/Password or Social Sign-in.
- **Firestore Database:** Activate Firestore in the console to store and retrieve data.
- **Firebase Storage:** Enable Storage to handle file uploads and downloads.

:::

## 4. Deploy to Firebase

The final step is to deploy the generated schemas, indexes, and rules to Firebase so they become active in your project. For example, in a habit tracker app, Dreamflow deploys rules that allow only the authenticated user to modify their habits collection.

To deploy to Firebase:

1. In the **Actions** panel, go to **Deploy to Firebase**. Under **Deployment Target**, select the Firebase service you want to deploy to (default is *Firestore*).
2. Click **Deploy Changes**.

:::info

- Until you deploy, rules and schemas only exist in Dreamflow and are not sent to Firebase.
- Dreamflow uses the Firebase CLI to push security rules, indexes, and any additional configurations (e.g., Auth, Storage) to Firebase.

:::

:::warning

This step is critical for security, as without rules, your Firestore may be open to anyone.

::::

![deploy-to-firebase.avif](imgs/deploy-to-firebase.avif)

## 5. Configure Authentication

If the generated client code includes authentication-related functionality, you must configure sign-in providers in the Firebase Console to make it work.

To enable authentication, click **Configure Authentication**. This opens the Authentication page in the Firebase Console, where you can select a sign-in provider such as Email/Password, Google, or Facebook. Enable the chosen provider, configure its settings (for example, OAuth credentials for Google or Facebook), and click **Save**. Repeat this process to enable any additional providers required by your app.

Here’s an example of enabling email/password authentication:

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(52.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding

            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}

        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p></p>

### Google Authentication

To configure Google Sign-In for your app, follow these steps:

#### 1. Enable Google Authentication in Firebase Console

In the **Firebase Console**, go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**, select **Google**, and enable it. Click **Save** to confirm.

#### 2. Add SHA-1 Key for Android

For Android apps, generate your SHA-1 key by following the instructions in the [Google Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth). Then, open the **Firebase Console > Project Settings**, scroll to **Your Apps** section, select your Android app, and under **SHA certificate fingerprints**, click **Add fingerprint**. Paste the SHA-1 key and click **Save**.

![add-sha-1-key.avif](imgs/add-sha-1-key.avif)

#### 3. Update Firebase Configuration Files

After enabling Google Authentication, download the latest Firebase configuration files, i.e., `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS, from the Firebase Console, and then upload these files to your Dreamflow app at the following location:

- Place the `google-services.json` file inside your project at `android/app/`.
- Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file inside `ios/Runner/`.

![update-firebase-configuration-file.avif](imgs/update-firebase-configuration-file.avif)

#### 4. Add Google Authentication Code

You can add the Google sign-in code manually or let the Dreamflow Agent generate it for you. Here’s the **sample agent prompt** you can try:

```jsx
Generate Google Sign-In authentication code for both mobile and web using the latest versions of firebase_auth and google_sign_in Dart packages.
```
#### 5. Add Authorized Domain

If you’re building for the web and want to test authentication while running your app in Dreamflow, follow the steps in the [Add Authorized Domain](#add-authorized-domain) section to add your Dreamflow preview domain to the Authorized Domains list in the Firebase Console.

### Facebook Authentication

To enable Facebook login in your app, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Set Up a Facebook Developer App

Before getting started, create and configure your [**Facebook Developer App**](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). During setup, enable the **Facebook Login** product and complete the basic configuration.

#### 2. Enable Facebook Authentication in Firebase Console

1. In the **Firebase Console**, go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**. Select **Facebook** and enable it.
2. You’ll be prompted to enter your **App ID** and **App Secret**, which you can find in your Facebook Developer App Dashboard under **App** **Settings > Basic**.

    ![add-app-details.avif](imgs/add-app-details.avif)

3. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URI** displayed in Firebase and add it to your Facebook app settings under **Facebook Login > Settings > Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**.

    ![add-facebook-uri.avif](imgs/add-facebook-uri.avif)

4. Click **Save** in Firebase once everything is configured.

#### 3. Add Facebook Authentication Code

You can add the Facebook sign-in code manually or let the Dreamflow Agent generate it for you. Here’s the **sample agent prompt** you can try:

```jsx
Generate Facebook authentication code for both mobile and web using the latest versions of firebase_auth and flutter_facebook_auth Dart packages.
```

#### 4. Configure Platform-Specific Code

Once the authentication code is added, you’ll need to configure your project for **Android** and **iOS** to ensure the Facebook sign-in works properly.

- **For Android:** Follow the setup guide in the [Facebook Android configuration documentation](https://facebook.meedu.app/docs/7.x.x/android).
- **For iOS:** Refer to the [Facebook iOS configuration guide](https://facebook.meedu.app/docs/7.x.x/ios).

#### 5. Add Authorized Domain

If you’re building for the web and want to test authentication while running your app in Dreamflow, follow the steps in the [Add Authorized Domain](#add-authorized-domain) section to add your Dreamflow preview domain to the **Authorized Domains** list in the Firebase Console.

### Add Authorized Domain

If you’re building for the web and want to test authentication while running your app in Dreamflow, you must add your Dreamflow preview domain to the **Authorized Domains** list in the Firebase Console.

To add authorized domain:

1. Open **Developer Tools** in your browser; press **`Ctrl + Shift + J`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd + Option + J`** (Mac) to open it directly in **Google Chrome**.
2. In the **Console** tab, press **Ctrl + F** (or **Cmd + F** on Mac) and search for `dreamflow.cloud`.
Locate the log entry that contains a URL like: `wss://summer-firefly-vuh34ynj.mum0.dreamflow.cloud`
3. Copy the domain part — for example: `summer-firefly-vuh34ynj.mum0.dreamflow.cloud`
4. Go to the **Firebase Console** → **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized Domains**. Click **Add Domain**, paste the copied Dreamflow domain, and click **Save**.
5. Reload and test your app.

![add-authorized-domain](imgs/add-authorized-domain.avif)



## Add Sample Data to Firebase

Dreamflow lets you add sample data to your Firebase project for easier development and testing. The generated data follows your app’s schema, so you can quickly check how your app works with populated users, collections, and documents.

To add sample data from Dreamflow, go to the **Firebase > Sample Data**, and follow the instructions below:

- **For Apps with Login Functionality:** First, sign up in your app using an email and password. After logging in, enter the same email address in the **User Email** field and click **Generate Sample Data**. This will generate sample records linked to that user account.

![add-sample-data-firebase-with-login.avif](imgs/add-sample-data-firebase-with-login.avif)

- **For Apps without Login Functionality:** You can skip the email step, as it’s optional. Simply click **Generate Sample Data** to generate test documents directly in your Firestore Database.

![add-sample-data-firebase-without-login.avif](imgs/add-sample-data-firebase-wihtout-login.avif)

:::warning

You can only generate sample data **once.** If you need to modify or remove the sample data later, you can do so directly in the **Firebase Console** under **Firestore Database**.

:::

:::info

This process only inserts sample data into the **Firestore Database** for the specified user email. It does **not** create a user in Firebase Authentication. Make sure the user with the specified email exists in Firebase Authentication to be able to access the data.

You can directly add a user to Firebase Authentication. To do so, open the Firebase Console and navigate to **Authentication > Users**. Click **Add user** in the top-right corner, enter the user’s email and password, and then click **Add User** to create the account.

## Enable Billing

Certain Firebase services, such as [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions), require billing to be enabled before they can be used. If your project uses other Firebase services beyond their free tier limits, for example, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage (over 5 GB), or Phone Authentication (billed per SMS), you must enable billing on your Firebase project. 

To enable billing on your Firebase project, open the Firebase Console. On the project dashboard, click on the current plan and select the **Blaze** plan. You can either create a new billing account or link an existing one. During setup, you can also set a budget amount. Once your usage exceeds this amount, you will receive an email notification. After enabling, the Blaze plan will appear on your project dashboard.

## FAQs
<details>
<summary>
Why am I getting the error `functions predeploy error: Command terminated with non-zero exit code 2` when deploying Cloud Functions from Dreamflow?
</summary>

<p>
![cloud-fn-deploy-failed](imgs/cloud-fn-deploy-failed.avif)
Cloud function deployments usually fail when your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Firebase project hasn’t been fully set up with the necessary APIs and permissions.

By default, when you create a new Firebase project, some APIs required by Cloud Functions are not enabled automatically. In addition, the default compute service account may not have the correct roles to deploy functions. Without these APIs and permissions, Dreamflow cannot deploy functions successfully, and you’ll see deployment errors.

Follow the steps below to fix the issue:

1. To be able to deploy and run cloud functions, make sure to [**enable billing**](#enable-billing) for your Firebase/GCP project.
2. If you haven’t already, [**enable the authentication**](#5-configure-authentication) in the Firebase console.
3. Next, open your browser and navigate to the following URL: `https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list?referrer=search&hl=en&project=<projectID>` Replace `<projectID>` with your GCP or Firebase project ID.
4. Click on the **Create Function** button. GCP will prompt you to enable the necessary APIs: **Cloud Build** and **Cloud Functions**.
5. After clicking **Next**, you will be prompted to enable the **Cloud Run Admin API**.
    
    ![cloud-run-admin-api](https://docs.flutterflow.io/assets/images/cloud-run-admin-api-6289d1d79337a0f909d0e29e555335f6.png)
    
6. Now, you need to grant the default compute service account the appropriate permissions. In the next page, you will see the option to deploy an example cloud function like `helloHttp`. Deploy this function. You will be prompted to grant permissions to the default compute service account. The message will look like: `You need to grant the following roles to the build service account to deploy a function: roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder to <projectID>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.`
7. Click **Grant** to provide the required permissions and deploy the example cloud function. Once deployed, you can delete this function if you wish.
8. After completing these steps, go to **Dreamflow > Firebase > Deploy to Firebase**. Under Deployment Target, select **Functions** and click **Deploy Changes**.
    
    ![deploy-cloud-functions.avif](imgs/deploy-cloud-functions.avif)
    

With the required permissions granted and correct configurations, you should now be able to deploy cloud functions from Dreamflow without any issues.

<summary>
Why do I see the error `[cloud_firestore/failed-precondition] The query requires an index`? 
</summary>

<p>
This error occurs when Firestore needs a composite index to run your query, but the index has not been created yet.

When this error appears, it includes a link to the Firebase Console. Open that link, and it will redirect directly to the required index creation page in your Firestore project. Simply click **Save** to create the index.

After the index is built (this may take a few minutes), retry running your app. The query should now work without errors.

Why do I see the error `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied] Missing or insufficient permissions on screen`? 
</summary>

<p>


![missing-permission.avif](imgs/missing-permission.avif)

This error occurs when your app tries to read or write data in the Firestore Database without the correct security rules in place.

To fix this:

- **Redeploy rules:** Go to the Firebase panel in Dreamflow and [**redeploy**](#4-deploy-to-firebase) your Firestore security rules.
- **Update rules if needed:** If your current rules are incorrect (e.g., don’t match your app’s data model or intended access control), you need to update them. You can edit the rules manually in the `firestore.rules` file or update them using the Dreamflow Agent, and then [**redeploy**](#4-deploy-to-firebase) to apply the changes.

Once the correct rules are applied, the error should no longer appear when adding or retrieving data.
